## What I have accomplished:

-   Created a Quarto website project with a blog listing page and site pages (Home, About, Blog, Visualizations).

-   Rendered the site to the `docs/` folder for GitHub Pages deployment.

-   Set up a GitHub repository for the final project and pushed the full site structure to `main`.

-   Resolved GitHub large file rejection by removing the large dataset from version control and adding a `.gitignore` to prevent future large data commits.

-   Created a reproducible project structure with `data/`, `data_clean/`, and `scripts/` folders.

-   Added an initial Visualizations page and prepared it for publishing the first chart.

-   Next steps: clean a small dataset using a script, publish the first visualization with brief interpretation, and share the GitHub repo with a colleague for peer review.
